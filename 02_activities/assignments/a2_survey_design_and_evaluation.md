# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `3`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of my survey is to test the hypothesis that perception of popular music changes with age. In order to do that, I will develop a survey of Canadian population representing different age groups. The methodology that will be employed is stratified probability sampling, using systematic samples (in 10-year intervals).  
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population - adult residents of Canada (age 18+)
Sampling frame - Qualtrics market research database
Sampling units - 350 individuals in the following strata (which are also sampling units), randomly selected from the Qualtrics database
1	18 to 24 years
2	25 - 34 years
3	35 - 44 years
4	45 - 54 years
5	55 - 64 years
6	65 - 74 years
7	75 years and over

Using the Qualtrics market research database, 350 Canadians will be recruited randomly from each of the 7 sampling units (age group). This requires knowing the age of each individual in the sampling frame. 

The algorithm is as follows: 

1. Dividing the Qualtrics market research database into 7 non-overlapping strata based on a common characteristic (age).
3. Taking probability samples from each of the strata.
3. Analyzing these samples in combination. 

```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type
Stratified random sampling without replacement, performed in three stages:
1)	The sample is divided into strata and sampling units (groups of telephone numbers) are randomly selected from each stratum. 
2)	Final sampling units are individuals representing the households associated with the telephone numbers (one person per household is selected for an interview).
3)	For interviews, the survey split all respondents into volunteers and non-volunteers, and the latter were then randomly selected for long interviews. 

2. Sample size
The ten provinces were split into 27 strata by geographic area, including a number of CMAs each getting a stratum; other CMAs in some provinces grouped into strata, and non-CMAs also grouped into strata. A minimum sample size was established for each province to ensure sampling variability. The total sample size was 50,000 units across Canada (the sampling unit is defined as a grouping of telephone numbers linked to the same address). Of these, about 40,000 were sent invitation letters (80% of the total). Then one eligible member of each sampled household was randomly selected.

3. Target population
All persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada, excluding residents of territories and institutions.

4. Sampling frame
The sampling frame was a combination of landline and mobile phone numbers, and addresses in the Statistics Canada database. About 86% of all phone numbers were linked to relevant postal addresses, the rest were used as just phone numbers. 

5. Survey mode(s) 
First, based on Census and other Statistics Canada databases, potential respondents’ telephone numbers were matched to households (randomly). Resulting households received an invitation letter with a code to participate in an online survey (for one eligible household representative). The household and respondent data were verified during the survey. Thus, ineligible respondents were excluded upon answering sociodemographic questions (e.g., age or non-volunteering status). A notable feature of the survey was that to save respondents’ time, income and some other data were obtained indirectly, from other sources (e.g., tax records). Thus, the survey “linked” respondents to other data sources upon their consent. Another notable feature was that while all identified volunteers did long interviews, non-volunteers were identified and sub-sampled (so that only some of them then did long interviews). 

6. Timeline
The survey is done every 5 years (e.g. in 2013 and 2018) in September – December. In the latest survey data were collected during the period of September 4 to December 28, 2018.

7. Response rate
24,000 complete responses (about 60%) were expected, but the actual response rate was 42%. This was lower than for earlier surveys, but this result may have happened because of a growing emphasis on mobile phone users who were harder to reach compare to landline users. 

8. Weights
To address potential discrepancies between the sample and the true population characteristics, as well as to account for potentially missing data, weighting was performed at two levels: household and person. 
1.	Because of potential errors in how telephone number were grouped (e.g. some may have been erroneously attributed to the same household), some households had a probability of being reached through more than one record. To address this issue, an initial household weighting was developed, in which the weights for responding households were adjusted to represent non-responding telephone numbers.
2.	Then, in order to ensure that respondents’ specific characteristics were representative of the target population, a person weight was calculated for each respondent by multiplying the initial weight by the number of eligible (15 + ) persons in that household. These weights were then adjusted for characteristics (e.g., income, age and geography) to help match the true population characteristics. Similarly, these adjustments helped address the survey’s bias against households without telephone services. 

9. Data processing
Data processing included software and manual procedures to prepare collected data for analysis. After the data were captured, they were coded (including the use of standard industry, non-profit and other classifications where applicable and design of new codes for open questions). Next the data were cleaned to remove duplicates and non-responses, as well as those that were deemed out of scope, and to correct missing or incorrect information. Finally, some data were derived from, or combined into, categories to facilitate further analysis. 

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
Data cleaning included software and manual editing of the data, including checking for family links, consistency of data (e.g. confirming age by analyzing the birth date), out of range values, removing incomplete answers, etc. (see the response to Q9 above). 
Imputation included supplying missing information where relevant to provide a fuller picture for each sampling unit. This included imputing personal and household income information (as the survey did not include relevant questions and so the data, as well as income data for other household members, had to be obtained from other sources), formal and informal volunteering data, donation and solicitation data (where those were missing). 

11. Sources of error
There were two major types of errors: non-sampling errors and sampling errors. 
1.	Non-sampling errors may be related to partial or total non-response. Partial means a respondent’s failure to answer some of the questions, while total means a household or respondent’s inability to participate in the survey. These errors may also be related to incomplete coverage (differences between the target population and the sample related to differences in telephone service coverage as described in the answer to Q12 below). Some processing errors may also have occurred. 
2.	Sampling errors may result from a sampling error of an estimate, or discrepancies between sample characteristics and true population characteristics (i.e. the sample not representing the population accurately). 

12. Limitations, known biases, etc
The survey did not include Canadian territories (although another GSS survey, The Victimization Cycle, did include them). The survey also did not specifically target First Nations people living on or off reserve (although such people may have been among the respondents). Then, households without anyone 15 years of age or older were excluded from the survey. Similarly, respondents who did not communicate in English or French could not participate in the survey. Finally, households without telephones or those who could not be reached via telephone as they were not covered by the sampling frame were excluded from the surveyed population.
